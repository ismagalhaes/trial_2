how to make a new repository in Git and GitHub
On GitHub press go to the repositories tab and  click "create new repository"
Give the repository a name, decide whether you want to make a readme file, or other options and then "accept"
In the following page copy the SSH
Choose the folder where you want the repository to be on your computer
In that folder right click and do "Git Bash Here", this will open the Git command line terminal and write:
git clone SSH_address_copied_from_GitHub
put whatever files you want in the folder (like this one)
go to the folder with:
cd trial_2
git remote  # tells the origin
git status # tells what is going on
Now we need to commit this file , it involves the following stages:
1) git add filename
2)git status # should say a file has been added
3)git commit -m "message for what you are commiting"
4) git push origin main # pushes the commit so it turns up on GitHub
